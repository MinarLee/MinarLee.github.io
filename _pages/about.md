I am currently a Ph.D student, Vehicle Operation Engineering, [School of Automobile, Chang’an University](https://www.chd.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Shifeng NIU](https://js.chd.edu.cn/qcxy/nsf/list.htm). I recived my Master’s Degree in [School of Automobile & Transportation , Xihua University](https://qc.xhu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Daowen ZHANG](https://teacher.xhu.edu.cn/qcyjt/zdw/list.psp), and recived my Bachelor’s Degree in [Automotive Service Engineering, Chengdu Normal University](https://www.cdnu.edu.cn/wlgcxy/index/lgxw.htm).
My research interest includes *Big Data Mining, Automotive Active and Passive Safety Technology,  Reconstruction and Evaluation of Automatic Driving Test Scenarios*. The research progress focuses on **data-driven traffic accident risk identification and collaborative control, vehicle crash safety and human injury biomechanics**.

You can find my CV here: [MiN.L's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
